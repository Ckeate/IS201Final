                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>
                        <p>My name is Caden Keate, I am from Fort Collins, Colorado. I love the Outdoors, specifically Mountain Biking and Skiing.
                            I'm currently attending BYU and I am a Finance Major with a subfocus on Investment Banking. 
                            I was first exposed to Finance when I was about 8 years old by my uncle who was working at YUM!
                            Brand Foods at the time in their Finance Department. 
                            I've worked several jobs as a Service Technician in local bike shops, 
                            having to identify problems with bicycles and then repair them, as well as working with customers creating repair plans that fit their needs as a cyclist and budget. 
                            In my several years of working in Bicycle service I have grown to love the challenge of solving problems and the dynamic and changing work environment. 
                            In an industry that is constantly innovating I love the challenge of learning new techniques to repair new and innovative products. 
                            Something I love about bicycle service is the teamwork, a problem that one mechanic can't solve is a problem none of us can solve. 
                            So frequently we collaborate, and work together learning to fix new things and solve countless unique problems. </p>
                        <p>As I mentioned I love to ski and ride mountain bikes. Something I love about these sports is they give me the opportunity to push my self and my limits
                            by overcoming my fears and trying something until I get it, whether it's a trick or a particularly sketchy section of trail. One of my favorite riders and videos
                            is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W81ASQkjM7s">Matt Jones pushing the limits.</a> Matt is a slopestyle rider from England and he does a lot of things
                            that seem impossible on a bike. So click on the link and enjoy one of my all time favorite videos.</p>
